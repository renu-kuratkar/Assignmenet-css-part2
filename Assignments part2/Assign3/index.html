        <p>
            Haldiram's began as a tiny shop in Bikaner, the land as famed for its savouries as for its leather-faced
            pipe players and fierce warriors.<br><br>
            By 1982, Haldiram's had set up shop in Delhi and the capital had begun
            to stop by and take note of the savouries and sweets.It was word of mouth that grew the business
            manifold over the next decade till Haldiram's came tostand for a food company that was synonymous with
            taste, hygeiene and innovation.<br><br> USA was the first market we started exporting to, thanks to the
            large
            Indianpopulation there.We began with about 15 products, all savouries, because they are a favourite with
            Indians. What began as a small-town enterprise in india is today a globalphenomenon.<br><br> Haldiram's is a
            way
            of life for Indians no matter whichcountry they live in.And the Countries they live in are also fast
            developing a penchant for these products.
